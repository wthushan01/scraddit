# scraddit
Reddit scrapper written in Python that downloads images from given subreddits

This module depends on BeautifulSoup and requests.

# Version changes
**v1.0 (2019/09/01)**

Download images from subreddits that does not need age verification or any other type of authentication based on cookies. The issue with age verification is that it redirects to a different page instead of directly loading the subreddit.

# Future updates
What my plans are for this project as of now (Last updated: 2019/09/01)
- Fix the issue with pages that have age verification
- Need to add support for gifs and videos
